# Temperature-Sorting - Development
This was a creative assignment where I learnt the use of working with existing data.

We were offered a creative assignment where I created a windows forms application that would sort a list for you which I mainly based in temperature, meaning numbers in this case. This application would show you the lowest and highest temperature from a list including the average and difference in between.

This really taught me ways of working with data including data sorting. The approach I used I think would be great when going through historical data because through this application simple information can be derived about weather of a location.
